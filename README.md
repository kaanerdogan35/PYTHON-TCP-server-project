# PYTHON-TCP-server-project
Goal:The goal is to apply the concepts learned in class, through programming and hands-onpractice.  
At the end of this project, you will have a better understanding of how a networkedapplication operates and what are the technologies behind it.
Task:Design and implement a peer-to-peer file sharing application.  The shared design doc-ument specifies the necessary protocols that you need to implement.  Please follow the designdoc closely (in fact, verbatim) in your implementation.
Requirements:The application should;
1.  Have 4 processes: ChunkAnnouncer, ChunkDiscovery, ChunkDownloader, ChunkUploader.These processes should work as outlined in their respective specifications.
2.  Successfully detect the available content in the peers in the Local Area Network.
3.  Successfully download a content from other peers in the Local Area Network.
4.  Display an error dialog if a download is in error.
5.  Output a download/upload log,  containing timestamps,  names and chunk index of alldownloaded files
Please name all your files as [XXX][filename] where XXX is your team membersâ€™ initials.You may work in groups of size2 or 3.  You should determine a partitioning of responsi-bilities so that group members can work effectively in parallel.
